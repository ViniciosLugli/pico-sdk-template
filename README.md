# pick-sdk-template

This template is designed to help you get started quickly with your Raspberry Pi Pico projects using the official Raspberry Pi Pico SDK. The template project has a simple example program that prints over USB serial communication a overclocked frequency of the Pico. Follow the instructions below to set up, build your project, and use picotool for various operations.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

-   CMake (version 3.13 or higher)
-   A C/C++ compiler toolchain (like GCC for ARM Cortex processors)
-   The Raspberry Pi Pico SDK (version 1.5.1 or later)
-   Python 3 (required for some SDK tools)
-   picotool (for interacting with the Raspberry Pi Pico)

## Setup Instructions

### Setting Up the SDK

1. **Set Environment Variables**: Make sure the `PICO_SDK_PATH` environment variable is set to the path of your Pico SDK directory. If you haven't already, download the SDK from [Raspberry Pi's GitHub](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) and set the environment variable accordingly. On Unix-based systems, you can add this line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

    ```bash
    export PICO_SDK_PATH=/<path-to>/pico-sdk
    ```

2. **Clone the Template**: Clone or use the this template from github repository.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:ViniciosLugli/pico-sdk-template.git
    ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into the cloned project's directory:

    ```bash
    cd pico-sdk-template
    ```

4. **Initialize the Project**: Run CMake to generate the necessary build files:

    ```bash
    cmake -Bbuild -H.
    ```

5. **Build the Project**: Compile the project using the generated build files:

    ```bash
    cmake --build build
    ```

### Installing picotool

picotool is a command-line utility for interacting with a Raspberry Pi Pico board, including inspecting and programming the flash memory.

1. **Install picotool**: Follow the instructions on the [picotool GitHub repository](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool) to download and install picotool.

2. **Using picotool**: With the Pico connected to your computer (while holding the BOOTSEL button if necessary), you can use picotool commands. For example, to get information about your Pico, use:

    ```bash
    picotool info
    ```

## Flashing to the Pico

After building the project and having picotool installed, you can flash the `.uf2` file to your Raspberry Pi Pico:

1. Connect your Pico to your computer.
2. Run the following command to flash the `.uf2` file to the Pico:

    ```bash
    picotool load -x build/main.uf2 -f
    ```

The Pico will automatically reboot and start running your program.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, ensure the following:

-   Your Raspberry Pi Pico SDK is updated and correctly set up.
-   picotool is correctly installed and in your system's PATH.
-   You have the correct permissions to access the Pico when connected to your computer.
-   The paths in your environment variables are correct.
